Repo for the joomla version of seeourminds.com , which will soon be coming offline.

### Note to self ...

This site uses an old version of Joomla and currently works with PHP 5.x (what runs by default on Ubuntu 14.04) only.

This site was ill-conceived and is obsolete in both a technical and as far as usability is concerned.

I have ideas, though!

I was hoping that I could put the joomla core code into the Site subdirectory, similar to how I now have Groja.com.

The plan was to then keep information about the customizations along side of that.

However that is not working and I must turn my attention to more important matters, hence this "Note to self..."

The ultimate goal is to get it all into a virtual machine running 14.04 at some point, so I can use it myself.

(I believe it was too complicated for others to figure out, hence the "usability" part of this being obsolete.)
